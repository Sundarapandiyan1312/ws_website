        <h3>TeraSmart</h3>
        <p>
          next-generation terahertz time-domain solutions set a new benchmark in speed, power, and
          performance. At a 50 ps scan range, our systems deliver over 125 traces/s, 6.5 THz of bandwidth, 
          and >100 dB of dynamic range, all in under 5 seconds. Reducing the scan range pushes performance even further, reaching record speeds of over 330 Hz. These performance levels remain 
          unmatched in the industry. 
          The newly-upgraded flagship system, TeraSmart, our most compact spectrometer, features high 
          power TERA15 antenna modules, ultrafast optical delay unit (1700 ps), and our new transimpedance amplifier for seamless industrial, academic, or OEM integration.
